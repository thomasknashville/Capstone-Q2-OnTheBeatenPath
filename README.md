# [On The Beaten Path]

This app is a gateway to discovering and exploring parks. It will give information such as location, accesibility
information, entry fees, and more. It features beautiful photos and is intended to help folks feel more included and
knowledgable before they embark on a trip. Additionally, this app has a robust social aspect encouraging like-minded
explorers to share experiences, knowledge, and questions, as well as challenge and inspire each other to get out there!
Users can create a profile, keep up with their groups, and post photos and commentary on their favorite experiences.
